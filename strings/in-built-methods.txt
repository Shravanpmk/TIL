Source: 'Dubstep' from 14th problem in A2OJ Codeforces - Div.2 (A) Ladder

Problem:

Find and replace all the "WUB" substring in the given string and
print the remaining words.

Solution:

In-built function, 'find', for strings finds the first occurence(index) of the
given substring in the given string and returns the index.

Another function, 'replace', lets us replace a portion of a string, or characters
within a range provided.

The approach is to find the first occurence of the given substring and replace it
with " "(one-space) and loop through till we are left with no occurence of the given
substring.

And, print the obtained string, after all the operations, which would be the string 
containing the words seperated by one or more spaces(which satisfies the problem statement,
because, only the number of words are being counted for checking with the judges' answer)

In-built functios:

<string-name>.replace(pos, len, substring);      // 'pos' is the starting position or index from which to be inserted
                                                 // 'len' is the length(portion) of the string to be replaced
                                                 // 'substring' is the substring to replace it with
                                                 
<string-name>.find(substring, pos);              // 'substring' is the substring to be found (first occurence) 
                                                 // 'pos' is the position or index to start searching from
