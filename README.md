A Collection of stuff that I learnt in Math and Programming

I've just started out as a beginner in Competitive Programming,
and I keep learning new things, like, Math concepts and Programming techniques, tips,and tricks.

I hope i'll keep learning new stuff everyday and update this repo as much as possible.
